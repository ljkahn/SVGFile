# SVGFile

## Description

I created this SVG generator to easily make quick logos.

## Installation

To install this app you need to download node and initialize it in your command line application.

## Usage

After node is installed enter the command node index.js and fill out the questions. After the three questions have been answered, check the examples folder, and a file called logo.svg will be there. Right click and select preview svg.
