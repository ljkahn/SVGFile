# SVGFile

## Description

I created this SVG generator to easily make quick logos.

## Installation

To install this app you need to download node and initialize it in your command line application.

## Usage

After node is installed enter the command node index.js and fill out the questions. After the three questions have been answered, check the examples folder, and a file called logo.svg will be there. Right click and select preview svg.

    ```md

    ```

## Tests

This project contains a shapes.test.js file that tests for accurate rendering of each shape. The tests show that each shape correctly takes the input and produces a match to the template created in the examples directory.

To run these tests, first make sure you're in the logo-generator directory, then type the command "npm run test" in the terminal. You will see output of the completed test for each shape.
